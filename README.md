## Instructions

To play the game enter a keyword and click the 'start game' button.
Only keywords that return more than 10 images can be played with.

Once in game, the images will be shown briefly and, after that, you can click away to find the pairs.
On the first click the timer will start and will keep track of the time taken to finish the game.

When all pairs have been found you will know the time it has taken you.
You will be able to choose from playing again with the same images,
cards will be shuffled.
Or you can start a new game with different images from a new keyword.

Have fun!!!
